Telemachus README

This program is still being developed - and so is this documentation!

This program aims to be a graphical front for ShellMS on Android. Built for macOS, users can select a contact on their computer, then send the message via their device.

Requires that ShellMS is installed on your android device. Grab it via F-Droid or from source here: https://github.com/try2codesecure/ShellMS
